  <p>
    I am an early-career researcher interested in public policy and comparative politics in both national and international contexts. 
    I specialize in policy process research across the areas of health and public health, crisis management, and digital governance. 
    I employ both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, often using original datasets, and maintain expertise in state-of-the-art computational statistics.

    I am also a passionate teacher in politics, business, and research methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am particularly interested in using innovative research to drive impactful policy improvements, engaging in policy advisory work 
    with national governments and international organizations.
