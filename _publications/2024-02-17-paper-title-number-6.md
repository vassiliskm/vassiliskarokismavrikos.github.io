excerpt: 'In this chapter, we have argued that policy style interacted with political trust to shape the Greek response to the crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We showed that when the pandemic hit the country in February 2020, Greece exhibited an administrative style coupled with low trust in government and other relevant public institutions. Focusing on measures taken during the response phase, that is, reaction to the pandemic, we have confirmed our hypothesis. However, we have also uncovered a certain dynamism driven by feedback from earlier response measures. While we anticipated a more-or-less “fixed,” that is, centralized response, we also uncovered centrifugaltendencies during the second wave.  Command and coordination remained firmly in central–national hands throughout the two waves. But the message changed as the trade-off between public health and economic performance became more visible, and politically pressing, while there were attempts at more regionally nuanced outcomes. To be sure, centralization is still the norm—after all, policy styles cast a long shadow onto the future— but trust and the direction of response appear to wax and wane, further buttressing our argument for an interactive effect of style and trust on national crisis response.'
