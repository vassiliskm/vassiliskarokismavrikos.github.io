excerpt: 'The Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) has long enjoyed prominence as an analytical tool for the study of policy change (Kingdon 1984). Scholarly applications have spanned contexts and policy fields (Jones et al. 2015) and have been highly successful in uncovering the mechanisms underpinning policy shifts, especially in the decision agenda (Herweg, Zahariadis and Zohlnhöfer 2018). As change is dynamic, recent accounts have extended the MSF''s focus to the implementation stage (Fowler 2019; Sager and Thomann 2017). An emerging challenge in the literature concerns connecting policy design and implementation (Fowler 2022; Zahariadis and Exadaktylos 2016) to understand why some bills provisioning radical change succeed in shifting policy trajectories but others do not. We intend to contribute to this research agenda through a longitudinal account of public health policy in Greece. We apply the MSF toolkit to the study of public health policy change, centering our analysis on two focusing events: the 2003 SARS outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic. The first triggered the institutionalization of public health policymaking for the first time in Greece''s modern history (Bill 3172/2003) and the second tested the degree of entrenchment of the new paradigm nearly two decades later. In doing so, we evaluate the interrelation of policy design and implementation and uncover contextually-driven insights for the potential theoretical advancement of the framework.'
