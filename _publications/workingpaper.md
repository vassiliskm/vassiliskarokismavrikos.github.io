excerpt: "The EU is currently experiencing its longest period without a Treaty revision since Eurosclerosis, having evolved into a political system with a distinctive multi-level governance architecture. Therefore, EU-level policy change requires moving beyond the dichotomous focus of European integration theories and adapting the tools of policy process research to the EU level. This study applies a modified iteration of the Multiple Streams Framework—the EU-MSF—to two structural reforms in EU pharmaceutical policy: the revision of the General Pharmaceutical Legislation and the establishment of the new EU HTA framework. Drawing on primary data, the study examines the impact of policy network integration on the nature of favourable policy alternatives and the success of policy entrepreneurship strategies. The findings indicate that the level of policy network integration shapes the relative importance of technical feasibility and value acceptability and, in turn, informs policy entrepreneurship strategies, such as 'snooker-tactics' and 'recoil-tactics'."
